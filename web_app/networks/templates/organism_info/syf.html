<p><B><I>Synechococcus</I></B>.These unicellular cyanobacteria are also known as blue green algae and along with Prochlorococcus are responsible for a large part of the carbon fixation that occurs in marine environments.<I> Synechococcus</I> have a broader distribution in the ocean and are less abundant in oligotrophic (low nutrient) regions. These organism utilize photosystem I and II to capture light energy. They are highly adapted to marine environments and some strains have evolved unique motility systems in order to propel themselves towards areas that contain nitrogenous compounds. Motility may be due to the presence of spicules (long filaments) that extend from the cell surface and may act like oars during movement. <I>Synechococcus elongatus</I>. An obligate photoautotroph, it has been studied extensively by an international research community with respect to acquisition of organic carbon, transport and regulation of nitrogen compounds, adaptation to nutrient stresses, and reponse to light intensity.
